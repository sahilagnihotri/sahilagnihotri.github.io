A modern, intuitive task management application built with React and Node.js. Features real-time collaboration, project organization, and productivity analytics.

## Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can work on projects simultaneously
- **Smart Organization**: Projects, tags, and priority-based sorting
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual charts and productivity insights
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly across all devices
- **Dark Mode**: Eye-friendly interface for long work sessions

## Technology Stack

**Frontend**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Query for state management
- Socket.io for real-time updates

**Backend**
- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT authentication
- Socket.io for WebSocket connections

**Infrastructure**
- Docker containers
- AWS EC2 deployment
- MongoDB Atlas
- GitHub Actions CI/CD

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### Real-time Synchronization
Implementing real-time updates across multiple clients required careful state management. I used Socket.io with event-driven architecture to ensure data consistency while minimizing server load.

### Performance Optimization
With large task lists, rendering performance became an issue. I implemented:
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Debounced search and filters
- Optimistic UI updates
- Efficient MongoDB queries with indexes

### User Experience
Balancing feature richness with simplicity required multiple design iterations and user testing sessions.

## Results

- **500+ active users** within first month
- **95% user retention** rate
- **40% faster** task completion compared to previous tools
- **4.8/5 star rating** on product review platforms
