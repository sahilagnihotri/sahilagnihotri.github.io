A beautiful, feature-rich weather application for iOS that provides accurate forecasts with an intuitive, Apple-design-inspired interface.

## Overview

WeatherWise combines beautiful design with powerful functionality to deliver weather information in the most user-friendly way possible. Built natively for iOS using Swift and UIKit.

## Key Features

### üå¶Ô∏è Comprehensive Weather Data
- Current conditions with "feels like" temperature
- 7-day detailed forecast
- Hourly predictions for next 24 hours
- Weather radar and satellite imagery
- Severe weather alerts and warnings

### üìç Location Intelligence
- Auto-detection of current location
- Search and save multiple locations
- Location-based weather recommendations
- Background location updates for notifications

### üé® Beautiful Interface
- Dynamic backgrounds that change with weather conditions
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Dark mode support
- Accessibility optimizations
- Widget support for iOS 14+

### ‚ö° Smart Features
- Push notifications for weather changes
- Today and tomorrow widgets
- Apple Watch companion app
- Siri Shortcuts integration
- Offline data caching

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Core Data**: Local storage for favorite locations and offline data
- **Combine Framework**: Reactive programming for data flow
- **Core Location**: Precise location services
- **Background App Refresh**: Automatic data updates

### APIs & Services
- OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
- Apple MapKit for location services
- Core Animation for smooth UI transitions
- UserNotifications for weather alerts

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient image caching for weather icons
- Background data prefetching
- Memory management for large datasets
- Battery-optimized location tracking

## Development Challenges

### Dynamic UI Updates
Creating smooth transitions between different weather states required careful animation coordination and state management.

### Data Accuracy
Ensuring weather data reliability meant implementing smart caching strategies and fallback mechanisms for API failures.

### Battery Optimization
Balancing frequent updates with battery life required implementing intelligent background refresh policies.
