Web accessibility isn't just a nice-to-have—it's essential for creating inclusive experiences that work for everyone. Let's explore practical ways to make your websites more accessible.

## Why Accessibility Matters

- **Inclusive Design**: Ensures everyone can use your website
- **Legal Compliance**: Many countries have accessibility requirements
- **Better UX**: Accessible sites are often more usable for everyone
- **SEO Benefits**: Screen reader improvements often help search engines

## Key Principles (WCAG)

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are built on four principles:

1. **Perceivable**: Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive
2. **Operable**: Interface components must be operable by all users
3. **Understandable**: Information and UI operation must be understandable
4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough for various assistive technologies

## Practical Implementation

### Semantic HTML

Use proper HTML elements for their intended purpose:

```html
<!-- Good -->
<button onclick="submit()">Submit Form</button>
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/home">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>

<!-- Avoid -->
<div onclick="submit()">Submit Form</div>
```

### Alt Text for Images

Provide meaningful descriptions:

```html
<!-- Descriptive alt text -->
<img src="chart.png" alt="Sales increased 25% from Q1 to Q2 2024">

<!-- Decorative images -->
<img src="decoration.png" alt="" role="presentation">
```

### Keyboard Navigation

Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible:

```css
/* Visible focus indicators */
button:focus,
a:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #0066cc;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

/* Skip links for keyboard users */
.skip-link {
  position: absolute;
  top: -40px;
  left: 6px;
  background: #000;
  color: white;
  padding: 8px;
  text-decoration: none;
  transition: top 0.3s;
}

.skip-link:focus {
  top: 6px;
}
```

## Testing Tools

- **Screen Readers**: NVDA (Windows), VoiceOver (Mac), ORCA (Linux)
- **Browser Extensions**: axe DevTools, WAVE
- **Automated Testing**: Pa11y, axe-core
- **Manual Testing**: Tab navigation, zoom to 200%

## Common Mistakes

1. **Missing alt text** on informative images
2. **Poor color contrast** (aim for 4.5:1 minimum)
3. **Inaccessible forms** without proper labels
4. **Keyboard traps** where users can't navigate away
5. **Moving content** without pause controls

## Getting Started

1. **Learn the basics**: Familiarize yourself with WCAG guidelines
2. **Test with screen readers**: Experience your site as others do
3. **Use automated tools**: Integrate accessibility testing into your workflow
4. **Get user feedback**: Include people with disabilities in your testing

## Conclusion

Building accessible websites benefits everyone. Start with semantic HTML, add proper ARIA labels where needed, and test with real users. Accessibility is a journey, not a destination—every improvement makes a difference.

Remember: accessibility is not a feature you add later—it should be considered from the very beginning of your design and development process.
